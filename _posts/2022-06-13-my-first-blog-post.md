What are the capabilities of Datorama?


Datorama allows you to combine your disparate marketing sources into one data model and visualize it in branded dashboards.
These capabilities are essential for any digital marketing program with data coming in from different sources and with different metrics, 
dimensions, and KPIs. The Datorama Platform has a customized data model featuring pre-defined data relationships, 
so it combines terms across advertising platforms and standardizes the data to all work together. 
The benefit of the marketing data model is that analysts can avoid creating repeated calculations. 
Instead, we map each marketing source to the data model, and then analysts can use the same fields no matter what they’re reporting on.

Once everything is in one place, Datorama lets you create dashboards quickly and easily with InstaBrand. 
Datorama’s dashboard branding features allow you to match a whole dashboard to your brand guidelines rapidly. 
Simply upload your logo or company colors, and all of your charts, widgets, and dashboards will change color to match.
