### What are the capabilities of Datorama?

Datorama allows you to combine your disparate marketing sources into one data model and visualize it in branded dashboards.
These capabilities are essential for any digital marketing program with data coming in from different sources and with different metrics, 
dimensions, and KPIs. The Datorama Platform has a customized data model featuring pre-defined data relationships, 
so it combines terms across advertising platforms and standardizes the data to all work together. 
The benefit of the marketing data model is that analysts can avoid creating repeated calculations. 
Instead, we map each marketing source to the data model, and then analysts can use the same fields no matter what they’re reporting on.

Once everything is in one place, Datorama lets you create dashboards quickly and easily with InstaBrand. 
Datorama’s dashboard branding features allow you to match a whole dashboard to your brand guidelines rapidly. 
Simply upload your logo or company colors, and all of your charts, widgets, and dashboards will change color to match.


### What are the benefits of using Datorama?

Datorama is focused entirely on Marketing. 
With over 300 marketing connections in place, Datorama’s integration engine can connect quickly to your marketing sources, 
whether you’re connecting directly to marketing platforms, getting data from your agency,
or pulling from internal databases.

Datorama’s InstaBrand functionality saves you time by allowing you to update every chart and metric 
on a dashboard at once to match your company’s colors and branding, 
while other platforms would require you to change each individual trendline or bar chart.

Datorama can help you stay one step ahead of your competitors with Salesforce-powered Einstein Insight Bots 
that provide insights into campaign improvement or KPI optimization. 
Tell Datorama you want to maximize your ROAS or minimize your CPA, 
and you’ll get real-time feedback on improvements you can make.

Datorama creates cross-functional ease.  
The Media Cost Center lets you implement budget changes without ever leaving the platform.

Datorama provides a testing environment. 
Worried about breaking your reports when making updates? 
Datorama can provide a development workspace to test out your updates before pushing them to live reports.

With all of these tools at your disposal, 
Datorama empowers your marketing team to get things done.
