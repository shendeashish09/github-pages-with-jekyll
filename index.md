I'm a graduate of Electronics and Telecommunication 🎓 from Pune University 🏛. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains 💡. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ✨. I am a curious learner and programmer. I think [What is needed] is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science.
